The included files represent all of the components used in the partial assembly and creation of the trebuchet. File 'Trebuchet V1 - Assembly.iam' was intentionally constructed halfway to remain easily visible from all angles, resulting in an easier analysis and real-world construction.

Note: CAD file 'Trebuchet V1 - Acrylic Rod (78mm)' only serves as a placeholder file for the purposes of completing the assembly through Autodesk Inventor. The actual acrylic rod was provided and did not require fabrication.
