# MDF_Trebuchet_Design_and_Analysis
Project Type: Academic Team Design 

Project Role: Lead mechanical designer; responsible for all CAD design.

Project Overview:
Design and fabrication of a functional trebuchet constructed from MDF board, developed under material and dimensional constraints, capable of launching a 27-gram rubber ball a minimum distance of 6 meters.

Functional Requirements:
1.  Launches a rubber ball that weighs 27 g.
2.  Is made of:
    1.  1/4" acrylic rod for the main arm pivot point
    2.  Rope or string (group's choice)
    3.  Fabric for the pouch to hold the projectile (group's choice)
3. 1/8" MDF is provided, but the use of outside material is permitted.
4. Uses a servo controlled by an Arduino board to trigger the launching mechanism. The trigger must be made from the same materials given above. The servo must be removable from the device afterwards, and cannot be held in place using tape.
5. Uses supplied small sandbags as the counterweights.
